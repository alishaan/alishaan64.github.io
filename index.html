            <p>My name is Alishaan Ali.</p>
            <p>I'm from Mason, a suburb of Cincinnati, Ohio and attending Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. 
                I'm currently in my first year of pursuing a double major in computer science and economics.</p>
            <p>The summer before my senior year of high school, I attended my very first hackathon, 
                <a href="https://hackchicago.io/" target="_blank">Hack Chicago</a>, and I instantly fell in love with programming. 
                At Hack Chicago, my team was awarded the Best Social Impact Hack award for creating 
                <a href="https://devpost.com/software/occurren" target="_blank">Occurren</a>, a cross-platform mobile application 
                geared towards empowering parents of kids with autism to create meaningful relationships between their kids and 
                other like-minded children nearby. Being able to create an application that could solve a major problem in society 
                in just 24-hours was extremely empowering. This sparked my passion for computer science.</p>
            <p>With that passion, I joined <a href="https://masonhackclub.com/" target="_blank">Mason Hack Club</a> in high school. 
                With some other like-minded students at Mason Hack Club, I ran my own high school and collegiate hackathons and events. 
                I've run <a href="https://hackcincinnati.io/" target="_blank">Hack Cincinnati</a>, 
                <a href="https://cincyhacks.com" target="_blank">CincyHacks</a>, 
                <a href="https://jr.cincyhacks.com/" target="_blank">CincyHacks Jr.</a>, and 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://camp.masonhackclub.com/">Hack Camp</a>
                along with other events for nearly 600+ attendees. </p>
            <p>With my work at Hack Club I was able to land multiple internships. I interned for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ge.com/digital/">GE Digital</a> on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.servicenow.com">ServiceNow</a> Platform Development Team. I worked exclusively in JavaScript to build up user stories that got deployed into production at GE. Over the summer, I learned so much about computer science. This further reinforced my belief that I wanted to pursue computer science. I found myself losing track of time as I engrossed myself in figuring out minute problems in my code.</p>
            <p>I also had the opportunity to return to GE as a cybersecurity intern at GE Corporate. I was given the opportunity to develop full-stack features for GE's proprietary code signing service. I utilized GoLang, Docker, AngularJS, MongoDB, and other technologies to interface with GE's HSM and data centers.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy going to the gym, playing <a href="https://twitter.com/cooperlearns/status/1139712215227850752" target="_blank">cricket</a> with friends, and reading as much as I possibly can. Currently, I am reading "Never Split the Difference". Next up on my list is "Shortest Way Home".
