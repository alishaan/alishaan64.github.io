            <p> My name is Alishaan Ali.</p>
            <p>I'm from Mason, a suburb of Cincinnati, Ohio. I'm currently attending Mason High School as a senior in the Class of 2020. I plan to pursue Computer Engineering or Computer Science in college. I hope to one day work at the cross section of business and technology.</p>
            <p>The summer before my senior year I attended my very first hackathon, <a href="https://hackchicago.io/">Hack Chicago</a>, and I instantly fell in love with programming. At Hack Chicago, my team was awarded the Best Social Impact Hack award for creating <a href="https://devpost.com/software/occurren">Occurren</a>, a cross-platform mobile application geared towards empowering parents of kids with autism to create meaningful relationships between their kids and other like-minded children nearby. 1 in every 59 kids are diagnosed with Autism in the United States. Out of these, 40% are considered socially isolated-- they never see friends and half do not receive any phone calls or invitations to activities, according to research published recently in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders. Strikingly, researchers said that 28% had no social contact at all. Being able to create an application that could actually solve a major problem in society in just 24-hours was extremely empowering. This sparked my passion into computer science.</p>
            <p>With that passion I joined <a href="https://masonhackclub.com/">Mason Hack Club</a> where I am now the Finance Director. With some of my best friends at Mason Hack Club I have begun to run my own hackathons. We've run <a href="https://hackcincinnati.io/">Hack Cincinnati</a>, an event hosting more than 100 people at the University of Cincinnati this summer. We've also run <a href="https://cincyhacks.com">CincyHacks</a> for more than 70 attendees at Mason High School. We intend to run 1-2 more hackathons in our senior years.</p>
            <p>This all meshes with my desire to influence postive public change. I'm extremely active in Speech and Debate and have been named the Secretary of Curriculum for my senior year and the Extemperaneous Event Leader my junior and senior years. Along with that, I have qualified for the semi final round of the Ohio State Tournament and the quarter final round of the National Tournament. I also participate in Mock Trial where I qualified to the State Tournament my sophomore year.</p>
            <p>In my free time I enjoy going to the gym and reading as much as I can. Currently I am reading freackonomics. Check out my <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58788595-alishaan-ali">GoodReads</a> page!</p>
