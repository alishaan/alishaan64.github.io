            <p> My name is Alishaan Ali.</p>
            <p>I'm from Mason, a suburb of Cincinnati, Ohio. I'm currently attending Mason High School as a senior in the Class of 2020. I plan to pursue computer engineering or computer science in college. I hope to one day work in the cross-section of business and technology.</p>
            <p>The summer before my senior year I attended my very first hackathon, <a href="https://hackchicago.io/" target="_blank">Hack Chicago</a>, and I instantly fell in love with programming. At Hack Chicago, my team was awarded the Best Social Impact Hack award for creating <a href="https://devpost.com/software/occurren" target="_blank">Occurren</a>, a cross-platform mobile application geared towards empowering parents of kids with autism to create meaningful relationships between their kids and other like-minded children nearby. Being able to create an application that could solve a major problem in society in just 24-hours was extremely empowering. This sparked my passion for computer science.</p>
            <p>With that passion, I joined <a href="https://masonhackclub.com/" target="_blank">Mason Hack Club</a> where I am now the Finance Director. With some of my best friends at Mason Hack Club, we have run our own hackathons. We've run <a href="https://hackcincinnati.io/" target="_blank">Hack Cincinnati</a>, an event hosting more than 100 people at the University of Cincinnati this summer. We've also run <a href="https://cincyhacks.com" target="_blank">CincyHacks</a> for more than 70 attendees at Mason High School. And we hope to run 1-2 more hackathons our senior years.</p>
            <p>With my work at Hack Club I was able to land an internship last summer. I interned for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ge.com/digital/">GE Digital</a> on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.servicenow.com">ServiceNow</a> Platform Development Team. I worked exclusively in JavaScript to build up user stories that got deployed into production at GE. Over the summer, I learned so much about computer science. This further reinforced my belief that I wanted to pursue computer science or computer engineering. I found myself losing track of time as I engrossed myself in figuring out minute problems in my code.</p>
            <p>This all meshes with my desire to influence positive public change. I'm extremely active in Speech and Debate and have been named the Secretary of Curriculum for my senior year and the Extemporaneous Event Leader my junior and senior years. Along with that, I have qualified for the semi-final round of the Ohio State Tournament and the quarter-final round of the National Tournament. I also participate in Mock Trial where I qualified to the State Tournament my sophomore year.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy going to the gym and reading as much as I possibly can. Currently, I am reading "Freakonomics". Next up on my list is "And The Mountains Echoed".
